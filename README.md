## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have installed pandas. This can be done with the command "pip install pandas."
3. Run main.py with the csv file that you would like to use.
   * transactions.csv: example data
   * empty.csv: data with no transactions within the file
   * large_transactions.csv: data that tests large transaction amounts and what happens when the spending amount is less than the transaction amount
   * same_time_transactions.csv: tests multiple transactions ocurring at once

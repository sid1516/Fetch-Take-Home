## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have installed pandas. This can be done with the command 
```console
pip install pandas
```
3. Run main.py with the csv file that you would like to use. Provide a command line argument for the amount that you would like to spend.
   * transactions.csv: example data
   * empty.csv: data with no transactions within the file
   * large_transactions.csv: data that tests large transaction amounts and what happens when the spending amount is less than the transaction amount
   * same_time_transactions.csv: tests multiple transactions ocurring at once
4. Documentation can be found within the python file as well.
